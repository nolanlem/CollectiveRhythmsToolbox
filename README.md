Collective Rhythms Toolbox 

The "Collective Rhythms Toolbox" is a flexible and responsive audio-visual interface for exploring the self-synchronizing behaviors of coupled systems. 
As a class of multi-agent system (MAS), The Collective Rhythms Toolbox works with networks of coupled oscillators and coupled-metronomes, allowing a user 
to explore different sonification routines that generate emergent rhythms by allowing for real-time parameter modulation. Using groups of coupling matrices, 
complex coupling topologies allow for a variety of unusual rhythmic states to arise and audio-visual feedback encourages user flow and interactivity. 
Similarly, several real-time analysis techniques provide the user with visual information pertaining to the state of the system in terms of group synchrony. 
As such, different extant techniques used in computer music and contemporary composition can be carried out by parameterizing the system in specific ways 
which are explored from the perspective of dynamical systems based approaches.
