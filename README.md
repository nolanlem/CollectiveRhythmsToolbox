# Collective Rhythms Toolbox 

## about
The "Collective Rhythms Toolbox" is a flexible and responsive audio-visual interface for exploring the self-synchronizing behaviors of coupled systems. 
As a class of multi-agent system (MAS), The Collective Rhythms Toolbox works with networks of coupled oscillators and coupled-metronomes, allowing a user 
to explore different sonification routines that generate emergent rhythms by allowing for real-time parameter modulation. Using groups of coupling matrices, 
complex coupling topologies allow for a variety of unusual rhythmic states to arise and audio-visual feedback encourages user flow and interactivity. 
Similarly, several real-time analysis techniques provide the user with visual information pertaining to the state of the system in terms of group synchrony. 
As such, different extant techniques used in computer music and contemporary composition can be carried out by parameterizing the system in specific ways 
which are explored from the perspective of dynamical systems based approaches.

## examples 
The following videos shows the audio-visual output of 100 coupled metronomes. Each metronomes imparts small moments of inertia onto a 'shared platform' and over time the metronomes begin to phase align and synchronize.
